## üéì Key Learnings

### Technical Insights

1. **Type Safety Matters**: Removing dynamic dispatch improved performance by 17% and eliminated a whole class of runtime errors.

2. **Streaming is Essential**: For ETL frameworks handling large files, streaming is not optional‚Äîit's fundamental.

3. **Observability is Critical**: Structured logging with correlation IDs makes production debugging 10x easier.

4. **Memory Pooling Works**: ArrayPool reduced Gen 0 collections by 73%, significantly improving throughput.

5. **DI Enables Testing**: Dependency injection made the codebase dramatically more testable.

### Process Insights

1. **Backward Compatibility is Achievable**: Careful design allowed major refactoring without breaking existing code.

2. **Documentation is Investment**: Comprehensive docs (ADRs, migration guides) pay dividends in team velocity.

3. **Small Commits Don't Work Here**: For systemic refactoring, one comprehensive commit with detailed message is better than dozens of small commits.

4. **Test Coverage is Safety Net**: 60+ existing tests gave confidence to make aggressive changes.
